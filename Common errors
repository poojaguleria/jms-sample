 Error:
 http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/activemq-core.xsd' must have even number of URI's.
 Meaning:
 The xsi:schemaLocation attribute takes a list of URI pairs, where the first member of each pair is a namespace name 
 and the second identifies the location of an XSD schema document for that namespace.
 Resolution:
 Update the namespace/location in the relevant file.
